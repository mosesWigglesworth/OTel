I have shared a transcript on "What is Observability?". Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "Welcome to our lesson on observability. Say we have an IT system that we manage. A well-defined IT system will have several functional and non-functional requirements like this. Among the non-functional requirements, there are three availability, reliability, and performance that together give us the stability of the software system. Stability is a critical feature for any IT system, as it significantly impacts the overall user experience and the success of the system, whether it's hardware or software. But how do we know if the system is stable? We determine that by looking at the state of the system at any given time. So how do we determine the state of the system? We do that through output measurements we take of the system. This process of using output measurements to understand the internal state of the system is called observability. Observability is derived from control theory, and is defined as the possibility of observing the state of a system through output measurements. Now, let's say the measurements show that the system is not in a desired state. We can use observability data to control the system and bring it back to a stable state. In summary, observability allows us to understand and control the internal state of our software systems by analyzing their outputs. This ensures that we can maintain the stability, availability, reliability and performance of our systems, ultimately leading to a better user experience and successful system. So what are the measurements taken to observe a software system? They are metrics, logs and traces. And together they are referred to as telemetry signals. Let's learn more about these telemetry signals in our next lesson. See you there."

### 🔍 **What is Observability?**

Observability is the ability to **understand the internal state** of a system by analyzing its **external outputs**.

---

### 🏗️ Imagine This:

You manage a complex **IT system** (could be software, hardware, or both).

It must fulfill:

-   ✅ **Functional requirements** (what it should do)

Next one is "Telemetry Signals". Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "Welcome back. In this lesson, we'll explore the three key types of telemetry signals used to observe a software system. Metrics, logs and traces. First, let's talk about metrics. Metrics are point-in-time values that show the value of a measurement at a specific moment. For example, the highlighted data point in this screenshot shows the CPU utilization of the load generator service at 5:34. Metrics can be of many types. Common metrics include CPU, memory, or disk usage. There are also technology-specific metrics, such as garbage collection time in the case of JVM, or queue size in the case of message queues, and so on. Next, logs. Logs are records of activities or events within a system. They are arguably the first method ever implemented to look at the state of a system. Generation of logs are usually coded into the software by developers and are written to a log file on the machine. Logs usually have statuses like info, warning, error, critical, etc. to inform us if the software system is functioning as expected. And finally we have traces. Traces are the latest addition to the list and provide an in-depth understanding of the internal state of a system. We'll discuss traces more in upcoming lessons, but at a high level, they show us the path followed by a request through a software system and the associated time spent in each stage and a bunch of information that is hidden in this screenshot. We have an entire section dedicated to telemetry signals coming up later. We'll learn more about these signals in that section. Now, the term observability is a relatively recent addition. Until then, the process of measuring the internal state of a system was known as monitoring. And there were monitoring solutions, not observability solutions. In our next lesson, let's quickly understand the difference between monitoring and observability. See you there."

### 📡 **What are Telemetry Signals?**

Telemetry signals are the **data outputs** collected from software systems that help us observe and understand their internal state.

These are the **3 pillars** of observability:

| Signal | Icon | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 📈 **Metrics** | Numeric snapshots at a moment in time |  |
| 📜 **Logs** | Textual records of events |  |
| 🧵 **Traces** | Request journey across services (with timings) |  |

---

### 1️⃣ 📈 **Metrics**

> 💡 **Definition**: Metrics are **quantitative measurements** captured at specific time points.

#### 🕒 Example:

> "CPU Utilization = 85% at 5:34 PM"

#### 🔧 Common Metrics:

| Metric Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| 🧠 CPU Usage | % CPU used |
| 💾 Memory Usage | RAM consumed |
| 💽 Disk Usage | Disk read/write rates |
| ♻️ JVM GC Time | Time taken for garbage collection (Java) |
| 📬 Queue Size | Number of messages in a messaging queue |

#### 📊 Purpose:

-   Detect **trends** and **anomalies**
    
-   Power **dashboards** and **alerts**
    

---

### 2️⃣ 📜 **Logs**

> 💡 **Definition**: Logs are **time-stamped records** of events or activities happening inside the system.

#### 🧑‍💻 Who Writes Logs?

Developers **explicitly code** logs into applications. They're written into log files.

#### ⚠️ Log Levels:

| Icon | Level | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ℹ️ | Info | General operation logs |
| ⚠️ | Warning | Something unexpected, not fatal |
| ❌ | Error | An issue occurred, needs fixing |
| 🔥 | Critical | System failure or crash |

#### 📂 Use Cases:

-   **Debugging** application issues
    
-   **Auditing** behavior or access
    
-   **Forensics** after failure
    

---

### 3️⃣ 🧵 **Traces**

> 💡 **Definition**: Traces track the **full journey** of a **single request** across multiple services/components.

#### 🛤️ Example:

> A user hits a "Checkout" button  
> → Request travels through frontend → backend → payment service → DB  
> → Each step and time is **traced**

#### 🧪 What Do Traces Show?

-   **Start → End path** of request
    
-   **Time spent** in each service
    
-   Bottlenecks or failures across microservices
    

> 📌 *Traces = Powerful for debugging distributed systems*

You: 

Next one is "Monitoring vs Observability". Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "Welcome back. In this lesson, we will explore the differences between monitoring and observability. While they are related concepts, they are not the same. Monitoring has been around for a long time, whereas observability is a relatively new concept. Let's start with monitoring. If we were to set up monitoring for an IT system, the focus would be on application health, incident detection, and fast fixes. We would want the monitoring system to alert us as soon as the app is in an unhealthy state. The primary source of data for a monitoring system are metrics and logs. And incident detection is typically based on static values. For example, we can set up an incident to be raised if the response time or latency for a request exceeds 5 seconds. Some examples of incidents generated by a monitoring system are out-of-memory exceptions, high response times, log errors, and so on. However, monitoring systems don't provide the capability to understand the root cause of a problem. They might show us that the response time is high, but not what caused it to increase to five seconds. This task is usually left to the development and operations team to figure out and fix. On the other hand, if we were to set up observability for the same app, the focus would be on understanding the internal state of the system at all times. The data sources for observability include metrics, logs, and traces. Traces are an addition to what monitoring systems have. In addition to traces, another major advantage that an observability system introduces is the capability to correlate metrics, logs and traces and present the data in context. This is not a feature that traditional monitoring systems provide. Problem detection in an observability system can be based on static thresholds as well as automatic thresholds using machine learning or AI. This capability helps observability systems identify issues before they manifest into major problems. However, not all observability solutions provide machine learning or AI capabilities. Examples of incidents raised by an observability system would be similar to those of a monitoring system. But there would be more data associated with the incident to identify the underlying cause. For instance, if the response time is high, a monitoring system would raise an incident and stop there. But an observability system will provide more details about where in the complex and dynamic environment the problem occurred and what's likely causing it, thereby helping with faster issue resolution. In summary, these highlighted points set observability solutions apart from monitoring solutions. More recently, observability has become a buzzword. And many of monitoring solutions have rebranded themselves as observability solutions without changing any capability. I hope this comparison helps you differentiate between the two now. The ultimate goal of implementing an observability solution is to make a software system stable and reliable. There are a few metrics that give us an idea about the reliability of a system. Let's learn about those metrics in our next lesson. See you there."

Next one is "Reliability Metrics". Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "Welcome back. In this lesson, let's learn about few reliability metrics. Let's imagine an IT system in operation. The green line represents the healthy operation of the system over time. Consider that, at some point, the software system encounters a failure. The time between this failure and the detection of that failure is called time to detect. The mean value across multiple failure detection scenarios is referred to as Mean Time to Detect or MTTD for short. Once the issue is detected, the development and operations team starts working on the fix and finally brings the system back to its healthy state. This time is called Time to Repair, represented as Mean Time to Repair or MTTR. The system then resumes healthy operation and continues to function. until it encounters another failure. The time between the resumption of healthy operation and the second failure is referred to as Time Between Failures, represented as Mean Time Between Failures or MTBF. The total time between the first and second failures is referred to as Time to Failure, represented as Mean Time to Failure or MTTF. If you have a monitoring solution, it will help you decrease the incident detection times, thereby reducing the MTTD across incidents. On the other hand, if you have an observability solution, it will not only help you decrease MTTD, but also decrease MTTR and increase MTBF and MTTF. An observability solution helps reduce MTTR by providing details of the underlying cause, making it easier for DevOps teams to repair the issue. As the underlying issue is fixed, it helps prevent repeat and related problems, thereby increasing the mean time between failures and mean time to failure. The key point to remember here is that observability solutions help with fixing underlying issues. The fewer failures an environment has, the more reliable it is. Therefore, by implementing an observability solution, you get a more stable and reliable environment. In our next lesson, let's look at the generic structure of an observability solution. See you there."

## 📊 **Reliability Metrics**

> These metrics help measure **how reliable** and **resilient** your IT system is over time.

Let’s imagine your system running smoothly, until… 💥 a **failure** occurs!

To understand this lifecycle, we track **4 key metrics**:

---

### 🕵️‍♂️ 1. **MTTD – Mean Time to Detect**

| Icon | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ⏱️ | Average time taken to **detect** a failure |

> ⏳ *From the moment a failure happens ➡️ until someone/monitor notices it*

🟩 Healthy  
🔴 Failure Occurs  
🕵️ **MTTD** = Time until detection

🕑 **MTTR** = Detection → Root cause analysis → Fix → Recovery

> 🎯 **Goal**: Lower MTTR means faster recovery  
> 🧠 **Observability** helps reduce MTTR by showing *why* things broke

---

### 🔁 3. **MTBF – Mean Time Between Failures**

| Icon | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🔄 | Average time between **two consecutive failures** |

> 🕓 *From the moment system is fixed ➡️ until it fails again*

🟢 Healthy operation → 🔴 New failure  
📈 **MTBF** = Long healthy time = High reliability

> 🎯 **Goal**: Higher MTBF = Fewer interruptions

---

### 🧱 4. **MTTF – Mean Time to Failure**

| Icon | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 💥 | Average time from system start ➡️ to next failure |

> Used especially for **non-repairable systems** (like hardware)

🟢 Start ➡️ 🔴 First failure  
📏 **MTTF** = Time before breakdown

> 🎯 **Goal**: Maximize MTTF = Longer lifespan of systems

Next one is "Observability Solutions". Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "Welcome back. In this lesson, we will explore the key components of an observability solution. An observability solution typically has three main components. A way to collect the telemetry data. A back end server that processes the collected data. And a way to transmit the collected data to the back end server. Data collection can be achieved using various methods. It can be through agents, which are additional software that you install on your application server or APIs or SDKs, which are software code that you can manually add to your application code or other methods such as scraping, which are non-invasive. The telemetry data then follows either a direct path to the back end server or goes through a proxy. This proxy may provide functionalities like aggregation, processing, data compression, etc. the protocol used for data transfer can be Https or custom protocols. Finally, there is the observability backend that processes and analyzes the telemetry data. The server provides an interface to interact with the data, set up, incident rules, and much more. The backend might be on premises, in the cloud, or a hybrid implementation with both on premise and cloud components. Opentelemetry's capabilities lie in the collection and transmission of telemetry data. The Opentelemetry project leaves the choice of the backend server to the user. We will learn more about this in the upcoming sections of this course. The Opentelemetry website lists more than 40 vendors who natively support consuming Opentelemetry data on their doc page. There are both open source and commercial solutions in this list. Please take a look through this page to see if you recognize any names. With that, we have come to the end of this section on observability. I think we have now laid enough foundation to begin our opentelemetry learning.
