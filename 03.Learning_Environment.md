You: 

I am going to share some of the transcripts under the Section "Setting up Learning Environment" in context with OpenTelemetry. Some transcripts will be 17 mins long and some of them will be around 4 mins to 7 mins long. I don't want you to skip any part of the transcript and no excuses. Take your time and provide qualitative , crystal clear explanation with interactive icons. Shall we begin ? Are you ready?

ChatGPT: 

Absolutely, I'm ready! ✅

Please go ahead and share the first transcript under the **"Setting up Learning Environment"** section of your OpenTelemetry course. I’ll provide a **qualitative, crystal-clear explanation** with **interactive icons** as requested — no skipping, no rushing, and no excuses. Let’s begin! 🚀📘🧠

You: 

here we go for the first one. It's "Introduction". This transcript is 2 mins long , so don't rush up and you must not ignore any part of the transcript. Provide a crystal clear explanation with interactive icons. "Welcome back. In this section, let's set up your learning environment. We will be using two apps in this course to see Opentelemetry in action. The first app is called Hello Telemetry and is a very simple app that I put together for this course. The second app is the official Opentelemetry Astronomy Shop demo that's built and maintained by Opentelemetry community. Its purpose is to showcase Opentelemetry instrumentation capabilities. We will be using these two apps throughout this course to explain observability concepts and how Opentelemetry works. They will help you practice your knowledge as well as see how instrumentation works in different programming languages. In the next lesson, I'll walk you through downloading and setting up the required tools and apps and later explain the app operations. This will help you look at the components as we go through them. Now a quick note the hands on steps involve some configuration and coding, as that's the nature of Opentelemetry instrumentation. I have put my best efforts to ensure that all coding steps are easy for non-programmers to follow along. We will be doing hands on Java and Python instrumentation. But even though I'm using these programming languages, the steps will be similar for other programming languages too. As you will see now, if you are not familiar with programming languages or not interested in coding at all, you are welcome to just watch those lessons without trying hands on. I will be providing completed code for each section, so you can also run it without having to write the code. Thank you and see you in the next lesson."

You: 

Thanks , here we go for the next one. It's "Setup Learning Environment". This transcript is 17 mins long , so don't rush up and you must not ignore any part of the transcript. Provide a crystal clear explanation with interactive icons. "Let's set up your learning environment. Now the learning environment will require a computer with minimum four vCPUs and 12 GB of memory. This enables all the tools and apps to function smoothly. In my test, Opentelemetry demo takes about four GB of memory and has high CPU usage of the two apps. But I will show you how to tune it to use less resources. You are also welcome to use your personal computer if it meets these requirements. If not, you are still welcome to try on your machine, but I would recommend creating a VM in a cloud provider. Alternatively, if you don't want to run the demo apps, that's okay too. You are welcome to just listen to the course and in that case above, minimum hardware requirements don't apply. Another very valid option is to listen to the entire course first before coming back and trying the apps hands on. Now, if you are following along hands on, you will need Visual Studio Code. Docker open JDK, Python and the demo apps. I'm using Docker desktop here, but you don't have to use Docker Desktop. You are also welcome to use a non desktop version, and there are plenty of guides on the internet that can walk you through installing a non desktop version based on your operating system. Okay, let's go through the steps now. First let's download all the installers for the applications we need and then install them one by one. That will help make the process easier. I've provided all the download links and resources in a document shared along with this lesson. Let's use that. So please open up the document. It should look like this. And here it lists out all the applications that we need to download for to set up your learning environment. Now first step is to download Microsoft Visual Studio Code. So please click onto the link. And if you are like me and using the PDF on the browser window. Use Ctrl Click to open it in a new tab. Let's open that window. And since I'm using a windows machine I'm going to download the Windows Installer. But please feel free to download the installer based on your operating system. So the download should start soon. Okay, let's now go back to the PDF. Next Docker desktop. Once again I'm going to download the windows version. And one thing to note when using Docker Desktop is the commercial use policy. So it states that if you are downloading this Docker desktop or using it on a enterprise with more than 20 employees or more than 10 million USD in revenue, then you need a paid subscription. Let me download the Download the version for my CPU architecture. Let's go back to the PDF file that downloads. Next is open JDK. I'm going to use the Microsoft build of open JDK, but you are welcome to use the version from OpenJDK. And now scroll down. I'm going to download the package for windows. And once again you choose your package or binary based on your operating system. To do that. Go back to the PDF. We need Apache Maven. So just open that up. Once again control click to open it in a new tab. Now from here scroll down and I'm going to use the zip. Okay. Next is the Python installer. Again to that location, and I'm going to use version 3.13.1. The other things that we need is the hello telemetry app and open telemetry astronomy shop. Let's come and do that after we install these applications. So let's head to the downloads directory to install all the applications that we just downloaded. First is Visual Studio Code. Let's open that up. Now within the installer accept the agreement. You can choose your installation location I'm going to choose that. Keep the other default options. I'm going to make sure these options are selected and you can add these if you are interested. I'm just going to select those and hit next and then install. Now the installation has begun and it might take a couple of minutes to complete. So let's get back once installation is complete. Okay, so now the installation for Visual Studio Code is complete. Just click on finish and that should open up the Visual Studio Code window. I've got something selected there. I'll just open a new window and close that. This is what it should look like. Okay. Let me minimize that. The next is Docker desktop install. So let's start that installer. It may ask for admin permissions. Please grant those permissions. And now the installation has begun. So I'm going to select these options. Select I don't want a shortcut to desktop so I'll uncheck that. And then I'm going to let the installer complete. So let's get back once installation is complete. Okay. So now the installation is complete. It took about 2 to 3 minutes for that installation to complete. Once you get to this page click on close. And then you can start up Docker Desktop. Search for Docker Desktop and open that up. So let me bring it to this screen so you can accept this agreement again. Once again you can see the commercial use policy. Please take care of that if you are working on a work machine, click on accept. And that brings up this window. I'm going to skip this. I'm not going to log in and then skip this to. You can see that Docker Engine is starting up. This might take another couple of minutes for it to start up the first time. Okay. So the Docker desktop has started up so looks to be all good. Let's go back to downloads folder and then now install Microsoft JDK. There we go. So this is Microsoft Build of OpenJDK. Hit on next. Accept the agreement. Hit next then install for all users of this machine I'm just going to use the use the default option. And then one thing that I'm going to change here is to set this variable. So it just sets the javahome variable on the machine and hit next and hit install. It may ask for admin permissions again. So just accept that. And that should complete quickly. We are done. Hit finish. Next is Apache Maven. So let's extract that folder since it's a zip folder. I'm going to do extract all and it's going to extract it to the downloads folder. So with Apache Maven there is no installer. So what we do is copy this directory into a preferred location and then we will add. It to the path variable to point it to the bin directory within this folder. So let's copy it and I'm going to copy it into my C Program Files folder. I already have an Apache Software Foundation folder here, but if you don't have this folder, feel free to create just a folder called Apache. Any folder name is fine, so we'll just use that and copy that directory there. And we will go into the directory. Go to the bin folder and then copy this path. Let's copy it and then open up environment variables. So in system properties head to environment variables. And then in the path, we just add a new path there and then paste that path into that. And then hit okay. Okay. And okay. All right. So the next one is Python. So let's install that. So here please make sure to check this to add Python.exe to path. If you don't check this here it can be done manually as well. So just hit install now and let that installation complete. Okay. So now the setup is complete. Click on close. Now it's time to verify if all these applications are running as expected. So we already saw Visual Studio Code and Docker Desktop running. Well next is to check the other installers. So let's open up a terminal window. So I'm going to open up windows Terminal. And then the first thing I'm going to check is Java. So just go Java and version. So that looks good. Next is Maven version. That looks okay too. And finally Python. And that looks okay too. Now if any of these give you an error make sure to check your path in environment variables. So I've added a sixth step here in the PDF document, which provides some links to documentation that shows how to set the path in different operating systems. Make sure to check those out. And if you're still having issues, please feel free to reach out in Q&A and then we can help you set those up. Okay, so now we have all the applications that we need. Let's download the apps themselves. So first let's head to the hello telemetry app. As mentioned earlier, this Hello telemetry app is an app that I put together specifically for this course. I'll explain the app itself in the next lesson, but here let's just quickly download the repo. Now once you are here, you will see that it's got multiple branches. We are going to start with the main branch, which is the vanilla version without any instrumentation itself. And then we as we progress through the course we are going to go through these different branches. So for example the one zero code branch shows the hello telemetry app instrumented with zero code instrumentation. We will learn what that means in the upcoming lessons. I'll explain this once again over there. For now, what we need to do is just click on the code and then either you can go download zip or you can clone it onto your machine. I'm going to do just download zip. So let's do that. Okay. So that's been downloaded. So that's in the downloads directory. Let me open that up and just extract it here. Okay. So now once downloaded please copy it into your preferred location. I'm going to copy it into a location called D hotel. So that's where I'm going to keep these files. There we go. Copy it to that location. And next let's download Opentelemetry demo. So head back to the PDF. Click on the link. And that brings up Opentelemetry demo repository. Now here you have got two got two options. You can either use the main branch, which is just download the zip file from here, or you can use one of the latest releases. I would recommend using one of the latest releases, as that is likely to be a more stable version than the main branch, because the main branch is in constant development and there may be updates that may have bugs in them. But I will let you choose. For now, I'm going to use the latest release version, so I'm going to click on that tag there. And then once here scroll down and then use the source code zip. And that should be downloaded. Once again hit your downloads folder. And then extract it. And once extracted. Copy that into the your preferred folder. So once again I'm going to use my detail. And copy it that I'll show you shortly why I'm doing this. So once that's copied I'm going to open. Visual Studio Code and then open that portal folder. So I'm going to go open folder and go D portal. And now I've got both those. Apps there. Now we are going to use Visual Studio Code for all of our coding exercises. So it might be helpful to have some additional Visual Studio Code extensions in my PDF. I've mentioned some of the extensions that I recommend. So if you, uh, look in here on step eight, you can see the different extensions that I recommend. So what I will do is go into Visual Studio Code Extensions. And then you can see I've got some of the extensions already installed. If you're doing it on your machine, just what you do is just search for Python for example. And then install the extension. And you repeat the similar steps for the other extensions that you have here for Docker, Maven for Java, and Intellicode. This will just help make your coding exercises a bit easier. Okay, so that's all the steps that we need to set up our learning environment in our upcoming lessons. Let's look at the different demo apps. See you there."

Ready for the next part? 🚀 Just drop the next transcript when you're set — and we’ll continue without skipping a beat!

You: 

Thanks , here we go for the next one. It's "About hello-telemetry". This transcript is 7 mins long , so don't rush up and you must not ignore any part of the transcript. Provide a crystal clear explanation with interactive icons. "Welcome back. In this lesson let's learn more about Hello telemetry. The app we will be using to learn open telemetry. Hands on. As mentioned earlier, this is a simple app that I put together specifically for this course. It has three components an Apache Tomcat running a Java web app, a MySQL database, and a Python service. The telemetry signal generated will be sent to open telemetry Collector, and out of those telemetry signals, traces will be forwarded to Jaeger. We will learn about telemetry signals collector and Jaeger later in this course. But here's a quick one minute introduction. We already saw traces in the lesson on the three types of telemetry signals, so let's skip that. The collector is an open telemetry component that acts like an intermediary between a data source and the observability backend. It can be thought of as a proxy server that receives telemetry data, processes it, and exports it to a backend of your choice. in this case. And finally, Yeager is an open source observability backend that do a number of things, including visualize traces and show us the path a request takes through the system. You will learn about these in more detail as you go through this course. Now let's see. Hello. Telemetry in action. First, make sure you have got Docker Desktop running. When that's up and running, open up Visual Studio Code. Right click on the hello telemetry folder and select Open in Integrated Terminal. Now this should open the terminal in that folder. And once this is up type in Docker compose up and the command here. So the build command forces the containers to be rebuilt. Force recreate forces the containers to be recreated even if the configuration hasn't changed. Remove orphans flag removes any containers that are not specified in the docker compose file and detach lets us use the terminal after this command runs. So this is basically using the docker compose YAML file there, which I will explain shortly. So let that command run. And when you're running it the first time, it might take a couple of minutes for it to download all the images and start up. So let's wait for that. Okay. So now all the containers are up and running. You can also confirm this within Docker Desktop. So if you open up Docker Desktop you should be able to see hello telemetry. And there should be a green circle against each of these containers just showing that they are all up and running. Now once that's up and running, open your browser window and navigate to localhost port 8085. My web app. Here you should be presented with a web page like this. It's a simple web page with a heading and a link. And when you click on the link, The Java app, fetches some data from MySQL database, then calls the Python service to calculate the average age, and finally shows all the results on the web page. And that's it. That's all this app does. We have already downloaded the code, so let's quickly review it. So open up Visual Studio Code and before we review it, I would like to make a quick disclaimer that I am not a programmer. So the app may not adhere to programming best practices, and there may be better ways to do this. I just wanted something simple that my diverse tech audience can understand and can be used to showcase Opentelemetry capabilities. I am confident that the app achieves those objectives, but if you are a programmer, I hope you will excuse any shortcomings. Okay, now let's go through the code. In the code. First let's look at Java app. There will be two files that we will be modifying in this folder. So one is the Pom.xml which has all the dependencies. And the second is my servlet Java, which has all the code required to get the get the data and show it on the results page. The My Servlet Java code is triggered when we click on the link on that page one and once initiated, it creates a connection to the database, fetches the data, and then prints it onto a table. The code then also calls Python service down here, which calculates the average age from the data and sends it back, which is finally shown on the web page. Now here you will see that I have also included a sleep code. The relevance of which we will see as we work through Opentelemetry instrumentation. Now this Java app runs within Apache Tomcat container. The configuration of for which you can find in the Tomcat folder. The My Web app dot VR is the app built by Maven and placed in this folder, and docker file has the configuration of the container. You can see that we are using a Tomcat image and also copy the My Web app into the container. Next is database, which is defined in Docker-compose.yml. It doesn't have a separate Docker file when it starts up. We initialize it with some sample data in my table using this init dot SQL. Next is the Python service, which calculates the average age on request from Java Servlet. Here is the code and the Docker file. And this is what it looks like. Architecturally, the Java Web application runs within a Java virtual machine. And when I open up the web page, Apache Tomcat handles the HTTP request. When I click on the link, it initiates the custom code, which uses a JDBC driver to establish a connection to the database and fetch the data. Once the data is received, the Java code calls Python service to do some computation. And finally the data is shown on a web page by Apache Tomcat. Here I have marked the code that runs within the JVM and Python into two colors. So there is the plum and the dark blue. Plum represents libraries and dark blue represents custom code we have. In case you are not familiar, a library is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to optimize tasks and solve common problems. These libraries contain reusable components such as functions, classes, and modules, which can be integrated into various applications to save time and effort. Here, the HTTP requests are handled by Apache Tomcat libraries and the database connection is handled by JDBC library. This means we don't have to write that code from scratch. Now the custom code within services achieves additional functionalities that we want. We will see the significance of this breakdown into library and custom code. When we discuss instrumentation. In our next lesson, let's learn about Opentelemetry demo application. See you there!"

ChatGPT: 

Absolutely! Let’s break down the **“About Hello Telemetry”** lesson (7 minutes) in a **qualitative, crystal-clear format** with **interactive icons** and **step-by-step explanation**. This is a core part of your OpenTelemetry hands-on journey, and not a single line will be skipped.

---

## 🚀 Lesson: About Hello Telemetry (App Overview)

---

### 👋 Welcome to Hello Telemetry App

> *"The app we will be using to learn OpenTelemetry hands-on..."*

🧪 **Purpose of Hello Telemetry:**

-   A **simple, multi-component demo app** created **specifically for this course**.
    
-   Built to showcase **instrumentation with OpenTelemetry**.
    
-   Keeps it simple — no unnecessary complexity, just enough to practice tracing and signals.
    

---

### 🧱 App Architecture Overview

> *"It has three components: an Apache Tomcat running a Java web app, a MySQL database, and a Python service."*

Let’s break that down:

| Component | Description | Icon |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ☕ **Java Web App** | Deployed inside **Apache Tomcat**, handles HTTP & app logic. | 🧑‍💻 |
| 🐬 **MySQL Database** | Stores data like names and ages. Accessed via JDBC. | 🗄️ |
| 🐍 **Python Service** | Computes **average age** based on data received from Java. | 📊 |

🧭 **Flow Summary:**

1.  User visits the web app.
    
2.  Java connects to MySQL to fetch data.
    
3.  Java then calls the Python service.
    
4.  Results (including computed average) are displayed.
    

---

### 📡 Telemetry Signal Flow

> *"Telemetry signals generated will be sent to OpenTelemetry Collector and then to Jaeger..."*

📈 **Telemetry Stack:**

| Element | Role | Icon |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🛰️ **OpenTelemetry Collector** | Acts as a **proxy**. Collects → Processes → Exports telemetry data. | 🔁 |
| 🔍 **Jaeger** | Observability backend. Visualizes **Traces**. | 🕵️ |

🧠 **Quick Notes**:

-   We’ll explore **Collector** and **Jaeger** in depth later.
    
-   For now: just know they receive and display traces for us.
    

---

### 💻 Running Hello Telemetry

> *"Make sure you have Docker Desktop running..."*

🔧 **Steps to Launch:**

1.  ✅ **Open VS Code**
    
2.  ✅ **Right-click folder → Open in Integrated Terminal**
    
3.  ✅ **Run Docker Compose command**:
    

```bash
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate --remove-orphans -d
```

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--build` | Forces fresh image builds |
| `--force-recreate` | Restarts even unchanged containers |
| `--remove-orphans` | Removes unlisted containers |
| `-d` | Run in background ("detached") |

⏳ It may take a few minutes on first run (due to image downloads).

---

### ✅ Verifying It's Running

> *"Check Docker Desktop – all containers should show green dots..."*

-   Open **Docker Desktop**
    
-   Find group: `hello-telemetry`
    
-   Check ✅ **green status icons** on all containers
    

---

### 🌐 Using the App

> *"Navigate to localhost:8085..."*

-   In your browser, visit: `http://localhost:8085`
    
-   You’ll see:
    
    -   A **simple webpage** with a header and a **clickable link**.
        
-   When link is clicked:
    
    1.  Java calls MySQL → fetches data
        
    2.  Then calls Python → calculates average age
        
    3.  Page updates with full results
        

👁️ **Observation:**  
This full request chain is what will generate **traces** we'll observe in Jaeger later.

---

### 📂 Reviewing the Source Code

> *"Now let’s look at the code inside Visual Studio Code..."*

### ☕ Java Web App (Inside `MyServlet.java`)

-   **Triggered by**: Clicking the link in UI
    
-   **Logic**:
    
    1.  Connects to MySQL via JDBC
        
    2.  Retrieves data
        
    3.  Calls Python service for average age
        
    4.  Displays everything in HTML table
        
-   💤 `Thread.sleep(...)` included
    
    -   For **demonstrating latency**
        
    -   Helps visualize timing in **trace spans**
        

### ⚙️ Java App Configuration

-   Runs inside **Apache Tomcat container**
    
-   Files:
    
    -   `pom.xml` – Maven dependencies
        
    -   `Dockerfile` – Uses **Tomcat base image** and adds built app (`.war`)
        

---

### 🐬 MySQL Database Setup

-   Defined in `docker-compose.yml`
    
-   No separate Dockerfile
    
-   Uses **init.sql** to pre-populate data
    
    -   Example: a list of people with ages
        

---

### 🐍 Python Service

-   Called by Java for **average age computation**
    
-   Files:
    
    -   `service.py` – Main logic
        
    -   `Dockerfile` – Defines Python container
        
-   Responds with computed result → sent back to web app
    

---

### 🧱 Visual Representation of Architecture

```scss
[User] → Webpage (localhost:8085)
       ↓ click
   Java Servlet (Tomcat)
       ↓ JDBC
   MySQL Database
       ↓ REST Call
   Python Service
       ↓
   Web Page (shows data + average age)
```

---

### 🎨 Color Code Logic

> *"Plum represents libraries and dark blue represents custom code..."*

| Code Type | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🟣 **Libraries (Plum)** | Prebuilt utilities | Apache Tomcat, JDBC |
| 🔵 **Custom Code (Dark Blue)** | Your logic | Servlet, Python service |

🧠 **Why this matters:**  
OpenTelemetry can **auto-instrument libraries** (like Tomcat), but for **custom logic**, we need **manual instrumentation**. You'll explore this deeply later.

---

### 📚 What Are Libraries?

> *"Libraries are reusable code blocks like functions and classes..."*

🧰 Libraries:

-   Save time
    
-   Provide **standardized solutions**
    
-   Example:
    
    -   Apache Tomcat handles HTTP — you don’t write socket code
        
    -   JDBC handles database connections — you don’t need raw SQL drivers
        

---

### 🧠 Why This App?

> *"This is not a perfectly coded app... it’s built to be understood by everyone..."*

💡 Key Point:

-   Simplicity over perfection
    
-   Designed to **demonstrate OpenTelemetry concepts** clearly
    
-   Avoids enterprise-level complexity
    

---

## ✅ Final Summary

| Component | Role |
| --- | --- |
| ☕ Java App (Tomcat) | Handles UI, fetches data |
| 🐬 MySQL | Stores initial data |
| 🐍 Python Service | Computes average age |
| 🛰️ Otel Collector | Routes telemetry data |
| 🕵️ Jaeger | Displays traces |
| 🔍 Libraries | Tomcat (HTTP), JDBC (DB access) |
| ✍️ Custom Code | Servlet logic, Python computation |

🧭 **Next Lesson:** You’ll now move on to understanding the **OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop** demo — a more complex, production-grade microservice app.

Ready to drop the next one? Just send it in — I’m fully tuned in. 🎯📘💻

You: 

Thanks , here we go for the next one. It's "About OpenTelemetry Demo". This transcript is 7 mins long , so don't rush up and you must not ignore any part of the transcript. Provide a crystal clear explanation with interactive icons. "Welcome back. Now let's go through Opentelemetry demo. Like hello telemetry. We need to start Opentelemetry demo app. So let's head to the documentation and find out the best way to do that. So open up your web browser, navigate to opentelemetry, dot IO, head to docs and then demo. Since we are using the Docker deployment, let's select the Docker option and here you can see the prerequisites. It states six GB of Ram for the application, but in my experience I have found about 4 to 5 GB of Ram is sufficient. Okay, so further down we have got the steps. The first step is to clone the demo repository which we have already done, and then we need to change into the directory and then run the docker command. The command used to start Opentelemetry demo is same as that of telemetry, except that Opentelemetry demo does not have the build flag as you can see, because we don't need to build the containers. And once the app starts up, these are the pages that will be available for us to view. We will discuss this later in this section. So let's head to Visual Studio Code. Right click on Opentelemetry demo folder and select Open in Integrated Terminal. Okay. Forgot to copy the command. So let me copy the command from here. Copy that. And in Visual Studio Code let's run the command. Now this might take a few minutes. If you are now this might take a few minutes. When you are running it for the first time. The first time that I ran it, it took almost 12 to 13 minutes for me to get all the containers up and running. So let's wait for that to come up. Okay. So now all the containers have started up. You can see a warning there for OpenSearch. That's okay. Even if you get this warning, we can fix that in Docker Desktop. So let's head to Docker Desktop and look at the status of the containers. Okay. So in Docker Desktop we can see that most of the containers are a big part of the containers have started up all right. But there are still a few that did not start well. So what we will do is manually start them up. So select the containers that have not started. This might be different for you. So let's select the ones that haven't started. One of the reasons for this high. Uh okay. Just selected them and then hit start. Let's see if they all start up okay. You can see them coming up one by one. Scroll down. You should be. You should. If you scroll down, you should be able to see more greens there. Okay. So they are all up and running for me at this time. You can see that with this green icon against it. Now, one thing that you might notice as the containers start up is high resources usage on your machine. It's not showing here now, but it might show up shortly. The amount of resources used might depend on your computer, but for me it's usually too high to keep going. So let's look at some resource saving tips. One thing that I have found is that the load generator service is what takes up a lot of resources. So modifying its configuration can bring down the usage. Let's look at that first. So let's head to the to the documentation to find the URL for load generator. So here's the URL. Just click on the link and that should open up in a new window. Now let's have a look at Docker Desktop again. That looks to be all good. And there it is. So it's running now. And what we do is either you can stop it or reduce the number of users. So this time I'm going to reduce the number of users. It usually comes up with 5 or 10. I'm going to reduce it to two for now. Okay. So now that should bring down the resources usage. If we are still too short on resources it's okay to stop this container two for now and restart it later. I will let you know beforehand in the lessons where we need it running. It's okay to have the load generator service in stop state, but rest of the services should be running. You can verify that by looking at the status column here. Also, if you see a lot of container restart loops, another option that you can try is to download a release version of Opentelemetry demo. So instead of using the latest main branch, try using one of the release versions or the other way around. If you started with the release version, try using the main branch. Now let's also quickly verify that we can access the application. So let's head to documentation and find the URL for the homepage. Let's click on it and you should be able to see the web page. So this is the demo application. Now this Opentelemetry demo app is developed and maintained by Opentelemetry community to demonstrate Opentelemetry capabilities. The core demo application is a microservices app and has 18 different services. It's built using ten different programming languages, has four technologies, and uses three protocols, which we will see in detail soon. In addition to the demo app, the deployment also has components like flag D, which is a feature flag system to control the operation of demo application. There is Opentelemetry collector, which is an opentelemetry component to receive process and export data. And finally monitoring and observability solutions Prometheus, Jaeger, OpenSearch and Grafana to represent the collected telemetry data. And this is what the architecture and traffic flow looks like for the demo application. And these are the ten programming languages, four technologies and three protocols used by the demo. In our next lesson, let's break down the operation of the demo application and understand the function of each service by putting it side by side with the web page. See you there!"

2.  🔎 Navigate: `Docs` → `Demo` → `Docker Deployment`
    
3.  📝 Requirements:
    
    -   Docs say: **6 GB RAM**
        
    -   Instructor says: **4–5 GB RAM** is enough
        

---

### 🧰 Launching the Application (Using Docker)

> *"We need to change into the directory and then run the Docker command..."*

#### 📂 From VS Code:

-   **Right-click** on the `opentelemetry-demo` folder
    
-   Select **Open in Integrated Terminal**
    

#### ▶️ Docker Command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-d` | Detached mode (runs in background) |

> ⚠️ **No `--build` flag** — because all images are pre-built.

⏳ First-time setup:

-   Takes **12–13 minutes** (downloads 20+ containers)
    
-   Might show **warnings** (e.g., OpenSearch) — often safe to ignore
    

---

### 🐳 Checking Container Status (Docker Desktop)

> *"Some containers may not start — you can manually start them."*

#### ✅ What to do:

1.  Open **Docker Desktop**
    
2.  Look for `opentelemetry-demo`
    
3.  If any containers aren’t running:
    
    -   Select them
        
    -   Click **Start**
        

🔄 Containers should now **turn green**

---

### ⚠️ Resource Usage Warning

> *"This might result in high resource usage depending on your system..."*

🧠 Common issue:

-   The **Load Generator** service consumes the **most CPU/RAM**
    

---

### 🛠️ Resource Optimization Tip: Tuning the Load Generator

> *"You can reduce the number of users or stop the container altogether."*

### 🔧 How to Optimize:

1.  Go to Load Generator URL (linked in documentation)
    
2.  👥 Reduce "Users" from 5 or 10 → to **2**
    
3.  🛑 Optionally: **Stop the container completely**
    
    -   Safe to do so
        
    -   You’ll be told in future lessons when it's needed again
        

---

### 💡 Alternate Tip: Use Stable Release

> *"Instead of main branch, use the latest release tag (or vice versa)..."*

If you’re facing container restarts or bugs:

-   📥 Try a **release version**
    
-   📦 Or try **main branch** (if you already used release)
    

Why?

-   `main` is **in development** — might have breaking changes
    
-   **Releases** are more **stable** and better tested
    

---

Ready for the next part? Just drop it in, and I’ll break it down like this again — thoroughly, clearly, and interactively. 🎯💻📘

You: 

Thanks , here we go for the next one. It's "OpenTelemetry Demo Operation". This transcript is 4 mins long , so don't rush up and you must not ignore any part of the transcript. Provide a crystal clear explanation with interactive icons. "Let's look at operation of each of these components by putting it side by side with the website. Right. When you open the website, these are the different components that are activated within the Opentelemetry demo initially. So it comes through the traffic comes through the front end proxy which uses Envoy technology and the front end which is built using JavaScript and Next.js. And the front end and front end proxy pulls the images from the nginx image service provider. And once it hits the front end, these are the different services that the front end reaches out to to serve that particular page. And you can see them on this web page here. So the first one is the product catalog service. This product catalog service is responsible for the different components that you see towards the bottom of this page. Right. And then once you click into one of these products and if you scroll down this information about the product itself. And if you scroll down there is a 'you may also like' section. And that's done by the recommendation service. And these products are selected based on the product that you have picked. Now if you move further down the page, there is a little ad banner that shows sale within the website and that is done by the ad service. Now scrolling to the top. We have got the currency selector. You can choose between multiple currencies. You can choose between Chinese yen or Australian dollar. And you can see that it updates the amount on the web page, and that is done by the currency service that's responsible for this selector here. Then we have got the cart service, which you can see as the cart icon. The cart service there. And once you add something to the cart it goes into the cart service. And then there is also the checkout service which you can see here. The checkout service shows the checkout page. Now once you reach checkout it reaches out to multiple other services in turn. You can see that the card service saves all the card data into a cache, which uses the Valkey technology. This is in case you want to go back to the home page and come back later to complete your purchase. This is where the card data are kept. Now from the checkout page you can see there is the queue service. The queue service is say if we have multiple people making checkouts, those go into a queue, which is the Kafka queue and it goes to accounting service and fraud detection service. So the accounting service is just using basic accounting info fraud detection, checks for any fraudulent activity in the transactions. It may not look major for a single user accessing the website, but once there are hundreds of users accessing the website, it goes into a queue for processing. Next we have got the email service here. So the email service sends out an email to the user once the purchase is complete. There is a shipping service which handles the shipping, and the shipping service also reaches out to a code service for the shipping codes. Now this is the shipping code for a single product. Now say if I go back to the shopping cart and then select a second product and add that to the cart, you can see that the shipping value has been recalculated. And that's done by the code service. Finally the payment service handles the payment. So once you provide the credit card number and the details, the payment service handles that payment request. And there you can place the order. And now the order is complete and you can return back onto the home page. And that is that in a nutshell is how Opentelemetry demo operates. Now that you have an understanding of observability and have the Opentelemetry demo application running, let's start exploring Opentelemetry in the upcoming sections. See you there."
